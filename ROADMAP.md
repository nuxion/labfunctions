**Details**
The goal of this release is adding support to autoscale machines for workers


## version 0.7.0
**MUST:**

- [x] Executios: Namespacing Execution ID for tracking loads. 
- [x] Executors: Execution ID injected from Web 
- [x] Notifications: slack and discord **keep working on this for the next release**

- [x] Log execution streaming
- [x] Custom Errors
- [x] Example project using nb-workflows
- [x] Split NBClient into UserClient and AgentClient
- [x] Tracks dockerfiles versions.

- [x] Projects: File spec change where each Workflow Name will be a dict (like serivces in docker-compose.yml)
- [x] Clients refactoring: One client for command line (with filesystem side effects), Another one as agent. 
 

**Details**
The goal of this release is a functional system that delivery the promise of remote execution of notebook for production loads.
With that in mind, the focus will be in the stabilization of workflows executions, adding tests cases, execution feedback and cli enhancements.


## Backlog

**independent from a schedule release**

- [ ] Sequencial and multiple executions: option to share folders between workflows. 
- [ ] Option to convert a collab into a workflow in a project 
- [ ] Option to create a project from a notebook
- [ ] Agent which communicates only doing long-pulling to the server see [Github Actions Runner](https://github.com/actions/runner) 
- [ ] Refresh Token: rotates whit each refresh request (idea: tracks refresh token with access_token..)
- [ ] Review private_key strategy, evaluate [sealed boxes](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/sealed_boxes) 
- [ ] Allows Control plane to spawn machines
- [ ] If a job dies by timeout or by a runtime error, the docker spawned will still be running, review this case. 
- [ ] Default project for each user ? this will allow uploading and executing notebooks from any place without worryng about dependencies. 
- [ ] Separation between client and server, settings flag ? base settings shared? 
- [-] Jupyter on demand instance (locally)
- [ ] Executors: Docker volumes specification **cancelled**
- [ ] Optional [Any] Dockerfile RUN command definition from settings. **Cancelled**
- [x] Executors: SeqPipe implmentation **cancelled**
- [ ] Security: constraint access by scopes(permissions) and claims(by project)
- [ ] In WorkflowState NBTask could be a List instead of a unique value, this could allows sequencial executions of notebooks. 
- [ ] Evaluates dockerfile generation only in server-side
- [ ] Prometheus metrics
- [ ] E2E: complete testing of project creation, workflows push and execution
